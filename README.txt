TYPE GUD
----------

A typing game that uses react with phaser-- a HTML5 framework. 

The goal was to hook up the typing logic that spits out the words per minute (wpm) and attach that to a 'Player sprite' or
avatar that moves faster as you type faster. The velocity would essentially be the wpm.That is the basic idea with multiplayer 
mode in mind. The text that you would have to type would be from the Eloquent Javascript e-textbook so you could learn something 
perhaps.

Main Technologies Used:
React, Phaser

Issues:
Coded before having a clear plan, not testing as often, keep starting from scratch instead of building ontop. 

What I Would Do Differently:
Write things out, test everything before moving on, keep moving forward instead of scraping ideas. I would also start with Phaser first
instead of writing out db, routes, react first since Phaser offers a lot more than I expected. There were a lot of tutorials that overlapped
with what I did-- like the high score page.

What I have so far:
I have a working typing logic but I broke it last night-- one issue is that the wpm logic is not there. Currently it adds +1 to the 
score if the word matches with what you typed. 

(In a different file for testing purposes; got thrown tons of errors working on this file)
I have an animated player that is hooked up to Phaser that would have been attached to the typing speed. I was going to add a spriteSheet (a background
to move with the player).


For the future:
I would like to have at least a working version before the cohort ends in 9/6, I have a better vision and be more persistent in finishing and coding out
a thought. Have an idea, execute it. After the cohort, I'm going to try again at Phaser to see the capabilities cause I saw a lot of cool stuff in the 
tutorials.
